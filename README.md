Hello there! I'm PatGau, a visionary developer with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. I'm always eager to learn new things and explore the ever-evolving world of technology. Currently, I'm diving deep into Flutter, Firebase, Rest APIs, Python, and more.

With a solid foundation in C, C++, Basic Java, HTML, CSS, and Azure Basics, I enjoy solving complex problems and honing my skills as a competitive programmer. My curiosity extends to the realms of AI, ML, and Ethical Hacking, where I find immense excitement in pushing boundaries and uncovering innovative solutions.

Beyond coding, I'm also passionate about content writing through blogging, expressing my creativity through sketching, and crafting compelling stories through video editing.
